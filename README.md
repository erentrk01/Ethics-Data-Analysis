# Ethics Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and data analysis for a study on ethical perspectives within information systems. The study involves interviews with professionals and students, aiming to provide comprehensive statistics and analysis on the current understanding of ethics within the information systems field.

## Abstract

Motivated by the growing reliance on technology and data, this study analyzes and investigates ethical perspectives within information systems. Using collected interview data from teachers, software engineers, IT workers, and students, the study provides comprehensive statistics and analysis of the current understanding of ethics within information systems. The survey sheds light on the importance of ethics education for university students and the structure of an ethics course. It also includes an investigation of an ethical dilemma in the IT industry, specifically related to Reddit's API pricing change.

## Introduction

[Provide an introduction to the project, its goals, and the significance of studying ethics within information systems.]

## Methods

The primary purpose of this study is to examine opinions about ethics education in computer-related university departments. Additionally, a real-life case about an ethical dilemma in the industry (Reddit's API pricing change) is discussed to understand participants' opinions about such ethical dilemmas.

### Research Questions

1. Why have a computer ethics course in computer-related departments?
2. Which subjects are important for the course?
3. What is your point of view about the Reddit API pricing change?
4. Are you familiar with the "Codes of Ethics for IS (ACM)"?

### Participants

#### Group 1: Professionals in the Field

#### Group 2: Students (No courses in computer ethics)


### Data Collection and Instruments

Data for this survey is collected through one-to-one online meetings using Zoom, with open-ended questions to allow participants to provide detailed responses.

### Design of Experiment

1. Identify the target audience.
2. Prepare questions for understanding participants' views on ethics in information systems.
3. Select a real-life case (Reddit's API pricing change).
4. Find participants through email or face-to-face communication.
5. Conduct the survey using Zoom or face-to-face meetings.
6. Analyze the results in-depth.

## Python Files

### Chart Analysis (q1.py)

This Python script analyzes the responses to the question: "Why have a computer ethics course in computer-related departments?" The analysis is presented in a bar chart using Plotly.

### Spider Chart (students excluded) (q2-ExcludeStu.py)

This Python script creates a spider chart to visualize the importance of different subjects in computer ethics. The chart includes responses from professionals and excludes student participants.

### Spider Chart for Students (q2-Students.py)

This Python script creates a spider chart to visualize the importance of different subjects in computer ethics, considering only student participants.

### Overall Spider Chart (q2.py)

This Python script creates a spider chart to visualize the importance of different subjects in computer ethics, considering all participants.
